# Ecommerce Robot Shop : Helm chart 

Welcome to the **Robot Shop** Helm chart repository â€” a microservices ecommerce application infrastructure deployed on Kubernetes using a three-tier architecture.

---

## Overview

Robot Shop is a simple example ecommerce microservices application showcasing a modern technology stack deployed and managed via Helm charts on Kubernetes. It demonstrates how to build and operate a scalable, modular ecommerce platform with separate frontend, backend, and database layers.

---

## Architecture

This project follows a **three-tier architecture**:

- **Presentation Layer (Frontend):** AngularJS (1.x) served via Nginx
- **Application Layer (Backend):** NodeJS and Python microservices
- **Data Layer (Databases and Messaging):** MongoDB, MySQL, Redis, and RabbitMQ

Each tier is containerized and deployed as independent microservices, orchestrated with Kubernetes and managed through Helm charts for easy deployment, scaling, and upgrades.

---

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend:** AngularJS (1.x), Nginx
- **Backend:** NodeJS, Python
- **Databases:** MongoDB, MySQL, Redis
- **Messaging:** RabbitMQ
- **Infrastructure:** Kubernetes, Helm
- **Monitoring:** Instana for automatic detection, tracing, and monitoring of services and requests

---

## Features

- Modular microservices architecture enabling independent development and scaling
- Kubernetes-native deployment with Helm charts for infrastructure automation
- End-to-end distributed tracing and monitoring with Instana
- Support for multiple databases and messaging queues for robust data handling
- Easy customization and extension for real-world ecommerce scenarios
